# To-do items

### For discussion

- Dates associated with names
    + We want LC-style name entries, but we also want to have separate dates;
      this is contradictory. How do we proceed? What about legacy data -- how
      are those names formatted?

- Format Other, and Other format field
    + This has been added, but it is almost certainly bad. Users will likely
      reject our categories and create their own, resulting in, for example,
      variations on stamp and bookplate that are arbitrary and unsearchable.

## Flickr

## Unordered list of stuff

#### All sections:

Clean up pages; improve layout

Manage position of side image, when resizing to smaller page layout

  - TODO Make image both fixed and responsive, from CSS comments:

        // TOOD: Placeholder for the evidence image div, so we can make it fixed
        // later. It's hard with bootstrap to fix the image *and* have it be
        // responsive to window resizing. If fixed, the text floats over and
        // covers the fixed image upon resizing.

#### Flickr ####

Move flickr_preview partial from shared to flickr/show view
